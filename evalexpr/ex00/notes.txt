• Create a program called eval_expr.
• It’ll have a function eval_expr prototyped as follows :
int eval_expr(char *str);
• This function takes a characters string as argument. This string represents an
arithmetic expression. For example :
"3 + 42 * (1 - 2 / (3 + 4) - 1 % 21) + 1"
• This expression must be calculated and its result must be returned.
• The string passed as argument will be valid (no bugs, no bogus addresses, no letters
or syntax errors, no division by zero, etc...).
• The following five operators must be supported :
◦ + for addition
◦ - for subtraction
◦ / for division
◦ * for multiplication
◦ % for modulo
The function must also support any amount of brackets
