HARD CODING:

These are the only user input combinations causing similarities:

User input:			1 1
Identical Rushes:	rush02	rush03	rush04
The rectangle:		A		A		A

User input:			1 X
Identical Rushes:	rush02	rush04
					A		A
The rectangle:		B…		B…		(Doesn't matter how tall)
					C		C

User input:			X 1
Identical Rushes:	rush03	rush04
The rectangle:		AB…C	AB…C	(Doesn't matter how wide)

The rectangles formed by special characters are always different, we don't need to take them into account at all.


STRING COMPARISON:

These patterns here hold the same information.

pattern = "ABABCBC"
pattern = "ABCBABC"
pattern = "ABCBCBA"

The meaning is basically: left top corner -> top middle -> right top corner -> sides (always the same) -> left bottom corner -> bottom middle -> right bottom cornerThe sides are always made by using the same characters and those are the only parts being multiplied.
